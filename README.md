## The *aha*

I wanted to write a media library for Android with Android arch components in kotlin with both custom theme and multiple selection, so here it is.

#### Named after 
[Amrita Sher-Gil](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/amrita-sher-gil/m09sphm?categoryId=artist&hl=en), a pre-eminent Hungarian-Indian early modernist painter who became known as the 'Indian Frida Kahlo'.

#### Inspired by 
The [Matisse](https://github.com/zhihu/Matisse) library

#### Sugar tho?
üç≠ I like sugar. üç≠
